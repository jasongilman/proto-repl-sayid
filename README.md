# proto-repl-sayid package

**This is a work in progress.**

This is the future home of a package that provides an Atom Package that integrates [Proto REPL](https://github.com/jasongilman/proto-repl) and [Sayid](https://github.com/bpiel/sayid) to provide a visual call stack and debugging in Proto REPL.

See the [Proto REPL Clojure Conj 2016 talk video from 27:13](https://youtu.be/buPPGxOnBnk?t=27m13s) and the [Sayid video](https://youtu.be/ipDhvd1NsmE) for background information.
